About this Page
===============

I really wanted to highlight all the things I am connected with on my Twitter bio but I became involved with too many things!

My lovely twitter acquaintance, [Ch33r10](https://github.com/ch33r10) shared their Github readme which includes public mentions of them and their work and I thought it was the perfect idea to house all this stuff. 

This is going to be pretty comprehensive and serve organizationally for me as an archive point as well as somewhat of a CV or resume.

I also want to highlight people / projects / conferences / etc. that I am connected with and feel passionate about.
