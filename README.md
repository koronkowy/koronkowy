About this Page
===============

I really wanted to highlight all the things I am connected with on my Twitter bio but I became involved with too many things!

My lovely twitter acquaintance, [Ch33r10](https://github.com/ch33r10) shared their Github readme which includes public mentions of them and their work and I thought it was the perfect idea to house all this stuff.

This is going to be pretty comprehensive and serve organizationally for me as an archive point as well as somewhat of a CV or resume.

I also want to highlight people/projects/conferences/etc. that I am connected with and feel passionate about.

Current Employment / Main Projects
==================================

-   [Atredis Partners](https://www.atredis.com/): My day job is being the lovely on-staff tech editor / tech writer for the attack research and penetration testing consultancy firm, Atredis Partners. My job also involves working as part of the Client Operations team in part of the sales engineering / scoping side of things, social media management including working on blog posts, being passionate about our vulnerability disclosure process, and wearing some other hats.
