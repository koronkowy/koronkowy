About this Page
===============
I really wanted to highlight all the things I am connected with on my Twitter bio but I became involved with too many things! This is something inbetween a CV, README, and linklist.

My lovely Twitter acquaintance, [Ch33r10](https://github.com/ch33r10) shared their GitHub readme which includes public mentions of them and their work and I thought it was the perfect idea to house all this stuff. Thank you to her for the inspiration.

I’m looking for work!
======================
Let's connect on LinkedIn!
[https://www.linkedin.com/in/laceykasten/]()

I’ve worn a lot of hats over the years but I’m looking to find a new role as soon as possible such as:

- **Cybersecurity sales roles** – whether it’s in development roles, sales rep roles, or in pre-sales engineering / solutions architecting.
- **Customer support or customer experience** – I enjoy helping customers and making sure their needs are met. Would be happy to do this work again.
- **Sales enablement** - I love leveraging my sales experience and technical writing and communications background to make the best sales enablement content to support sales. I love doing anything I can to make sales folks win, especially if it enables technical wins.
- **Event marketing** - I've run and participated in a large number of cybersecurity and opensource conferences and also have experience working running tradeshows in the tradeshow industry itself. I love events!
- **Community management** – I’m passionate about building relationships and fostering engagement. I also have a lot of experience organizing and running events, particularly in the cybersecurity space

I'm building out my MuchSkills portfolio here so you can take a look at the various skills I can bring to teams and projects: [https://app.muchskills.com/user/lacey]()

Current Employment / Main Projects
======================
- [HushCon](https://hushcon.com/): I started attending HushCon in 2018 at HushCon West in Seattle, WA. I’ve been back to HushCon West every year since. And now I am helping organize the conference as a sponsorship coordinator. HushCon is a premier security conference with hush rules on all talks that happen. I also attended HushCon East located in NYC in 2022 and 2023 and please [reach out](https://hushcon.com/sponsors.php) if you’d like to talk about sponsorship -- we have a really neat sponsorship prospectus that I help maintain.
- [stickerlife.org](https://stickerlife.org/): This is a small archive project that I took on a few years back to digitize and make archived in quality format any and all stickers that are part of the information security world. These are either mailed in or ethically harvested. I also design and make stickers & send them out (sometimes for charity, even)! I have the capacity to do small press runs of stickers, and want to do more.
- [blog](https://koronkowy.tumblr.com/): This is my little blog designed to look seamless with my other web projects. Here I share learning resources, talks, and other things that I have absorbed over the years summarized.
- [hackroost.net](https://hackroost.net/): ([gh repo](https://github.com/koronkowy/hackroost)) Tiny link list project that was a continuation of an old pinned tweet I had where I collected a list of places cybersecurity talks are uploaded on YouTube.
- [terms-list](https://koronkowy.github.io/terms-list/index.html): ([gh repo](https://github.com/koronkowy/terms-list)) In an attempt to make my cybersecurity notes cleaner, usable on mobile when I can't access my Word documents, and pull terms out to a simple list, this is an on-going list project of terms relevant to cybersecurity in my studies. My future goals include turning this into having flashcard capability for studying.
- [cyber-jobs](https://koronkowy.github.io/cyber-jobs/index.html): ([gh repo](https://github.com/koronkowy/cyber-jobs)) Keeping the same look and feel of terms-list, this is a page that details companies that are hiring for Cybersecurity jobs. These can be broad tech companies that hire security roles, recruiting companies that hire for cyber jobs, nonprofits, and defense contracting companies. Each company has a link to the careers page and it is searchable.
- [usbtree](https://usbtree.tumblr.com/): Visual curation blog that supports my art practice. It's full of artwork that inspires me & builds visual literacy. Started out in 2010 under different names.
- [m8m8e](https://m8m8e.tumblr.com/): This is where the memes get posted.

I was a frequent contributor to marketing content, educational content, product documentation, and participated in/around conference and event coordination.
- [Atredis Partners](https://www.atredis.com/): At Atredis, an attack research and penetration testing consultancy firm, my day job was being the lovely on-staff tech editor / tech writer. Due to the nature of my work, much of it fell under heavy non-disclosure. But there’s some fun public work that’s listed in the publications section here. My job also involved working as part of the Client Operations team in part of the sales engineering / scoping side of things, social media management including working on blog posts, being passionate about our vulnerability disclosure process, and wearing some other hats.
- [cabal](https://cabal.cx/) / [hatemail.io](https://hatemail.substack.com/): Editorial staff and key organizer. Worked in an international collective to develop and support projects that advance values of online consent, privacy, equity and liberty. cabal also participated in performing security assessments for at-risk and targeted people (https://cyberabuse.nyc/), creating, curating and supporting community works that progress personal security confidence, and monitoring pervasive threats online and investigating harassment campaigns. cabal also supported a diverse community in finding and vetting job opportunities, working with candidates to bolster their resumes and CVs, managing relationships with hiring employers to introduce talent, and developed a embedded job hunting platform. Work also included writing, research, and editorial support for unique editorials and news on threat intel, cybersecurity, hacking, privacy, tech ethics, tech-based harassment, politics & other relevant topics for hatemail.io.
- [secjuice](https://www.secjuice.com/): secjuice is a non-profit, independent and volunteer lead publication in the information security space where I previously wrote articles, collaborated with other writers and editorial staff, provided critique and peer review of other writers and more.

I wrote a lot of wiki entries and helped in discussing feature planning and collaboration.
- Sticker Cabal: This was a loose organization of folks found via Twitter who had large collections or make a prolific amount of stickers in the infosec/hacking world. We had mailings where members receive big parcels of stickers from other members or found at conferences, and team up with [attrition.org](https://attrition.org/) to do auctions for charities. Some of the work this group does included [Diecut Digest](https://straithe.com/diecutdigest/) and the work that [Straithe](https://straithe.com/about/) does there.
- [JuiceDB](https://www.juicedb.com/): Previously I used to moderate and work on the world’s biggest e-juice / vaping database about products. Countless hours spent adding descriptions of products, cross referencing official sites for data integrity, identifying tags to merge, categorizing tags, and user experience (UX) testing of the mobile application pre-release for Apple devices.
- [The Freeman Company](https://www.freeman.com/): My role at Freeman was as a customer support online content representative.

You can see more of AfterAll’s work at the main website as well as the [production side of the house site](https://afterall.tv/).
- [Bent Image Lab](https://www.bentimagelab.com/): In college, I worked at Bent Image Lab to provide client services support during the fall of 2011. Sometimes this meant wrangling coffee but the main goal was to make sure meetings with clients during scoping and review went smoothly.
- [Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA)](https://pnca.edu/) / [Museum of Contemporary Craft (MoCC)](http://www.museumofcontemporarycraft.org/): Throughout the years I had several positions and worked on a ton of projects at PNCA / MoCC that served as foundational experience. We worked to develop and populate events on the [web calendar and management platform](http://cal.pnca.edu/) developed in house, [content managment and website redesign for MoCC](ttp://mocc.pnca.edu/), and development and support (metadata / media management) on [Mimi](http://mimi.pnca.edu), the PNCA archive platform. I am probably forgetting some things, I wore a lot of hats here!
